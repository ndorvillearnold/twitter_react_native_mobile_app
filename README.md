# I wanted Mimic Twitter (React Native)
# I used EXPO to see updates to the project

This is a project I am currently working on to mimic the core features of Twitter using React Native. The project is in **progress**, and I am building it step by step, learning and implementing new features along the way.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to replicate the core functionalities of Twitter, such as user authentication, creating and viewing tweets, following other users, and interacting with posts. I am using React Native to build the mobile app, which allows me to create a cross-platform application that can run on both Android and iOS.

## How it Works

- **Authentication**: I implemented user authentication using Firebase to enable users to sign up, log in, and maintain their session.  ( I have not completed this section yet)
- **Tweeting**: Users can create tweets, and these are displayed in a scrollable list.
- **Follow/Unfollow**: Users can follow and unfollow other users, and the follow status is reflected in the interface.  ( I have not completed this section yet)
- **User Interface**: The UI is designed to resemble Twitter's layout with a home feed, profile section, and buttons for creating tweets.





- Sample Setup Checklist
Hereâ€™s a checklist to ensure everything is correctly installed:

 - **Node.js and npm are installed.
 - **Expo CLI is installed (expo --version).
 - **Android Studio and AVD (Android Virtual Device) are set up.
 - **JDK (Java Development Kit) is installed (for Android).
 - **Firebase SDK is installed.
 - **React Navigation is set up (if applicable).
 - **Environment variables are configured (if necessary).
 - **Android Studio for emulator
 - **npm install @react-navigation/native
 - **npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context

## What I Learned

- **React Native**: I learned how to build mobile apps using React Native, including using components, managing state with hooks, and navigating between screens.
- **Firebase**: I integrated Firebase for authentication and database management. Firebase's real-time database and authentication services made it easy to handle user data and sessions.
- **Navigation**: I used React Navigation to handle the navigation between different screens of the app. This helped me organize the user experience and allowed for easy transitions between the home feed, profile, and other screens.
- **Async Storage**: For persisting user data locally, I used AsyncStorage to save authentication tokens and user preferences.
- **Styling**: I used the React Native StyleSheet API to create responsive layouts and styles, ensuring that the app looks good on both iOS and Android devices.
- **Event Handling**: I handled button presses and other UI interactions, such as liking and commenting on tweets, using event listeners and functions within React Native.

## Improvements (Future Work)

- **Enhanced Features**: I plan to add more advanced features like direct messaging, notifications, and a search function.
- **Performance Optimization**: As the project grows, I'll work on improving app performance by optimizing rendering and reducing unnecessary re-renders.
- **UI Enhancements**: I will continue refining the UI to make it more polished and user-friendly, including adding animations and transitions.
